<h1>What is Our Medical System (With IMG Processing) ?</h1>
    Our System was build specially for the director of the Melanoma Cancer laboratory at Tel Aviv University.<br>
    The system include three algorithmic of image processing:<br>
  <div class="ul">
    <li>Count Cell- This Algorithm Count the cells in the image.</li><br>
    <li>Compare Between Treatments- In this section the algorithm measure the width of the cell's movement after treatment.</li><br>
    <li>DNA Damage and Aggressive-This Algorithm compare between DNA damage to aggresive in the same cell.<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>
  All of this algorithms work perfectly together and along.<br>
  There is a large use of image processing in our system due to all needs of Prof, Carmi Levi.<br>
  After almost an year we have working on this project we glad to say that our system works in the minimum time and maximum quality.<br>

<h1>Software Architecture</h1>

    <div class="s_headAbout">MEAN stack :</div><br>
    Ruby On Rails is the leading web application framework that include everything that programmer need.<br>
    Rails is a model-view-controller(MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database(MySQL), a web service, and web pages.<br>
    Our system sits on Amazon server with the opreting system Windows Server 2012 and Matlab-MathWorksÂ®.<br>
