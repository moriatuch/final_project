<h1>What is Our Medical System (With IMG Processing) ?</h1>
    Our System was build specially for the director of the Melanoma Cancer laboratory at Tel Aviv University.<br>
    The system include three algorithms of image processing:<br>
  <div class="ul">
    <li>Count Cell- This algorithm counts the cells in the image.</li><br>
    <li>Compare Between Treatments- This algorithm measures the magnitude of the cell's movement after treatment.</li><br>
    <li>DNA Damage and Aggressivenes-This algorithm compare the DNA damage to aggresivenes in the same cell.<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>
  All these algorithms work perfectly together and alone.<br>
  There is a large use of image processing in our system due to the needs of Prof. Carmit Levi.<br>
  After almost a year that we have been working on this project we are confident that it works in the minimum time and with maximum quality.<br>

<h1>Software Architecture</h1>

    Ruby On Rails is the leading web application framework that includes everything that a programmer needs.<br>
    Rails is a model-view-controller(MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database(MySQL), a web service, and web pages.<br>
    Our system sits on an Amazon server with Windows Server 2012 operating system and Matlab-MathWorksÂ®.<br>
